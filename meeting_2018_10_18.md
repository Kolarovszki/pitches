# Languages

## ProjectQ - Indepenent(?)
* compilation framework capable of targeting various types of hardware
* run quantum programs on the IBM Quantum Experience chip
* simulate quantum programs on classical computers
* emulate quantum programs at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., mimicking
  the action of large oracles instead of compiling them to low-level gates)
* export quantum programs as circuits (using TikZ)
* get resource estimates
* Syntax:
```python
from projectq import MainEngine  # import the main compiler engine
from projectq.ops import H, Measure  # import the operations we want to perform (Hadamard and measurement)

eng = MainEngine()  # create a default compiler (the back-end is a simulator)
qubit = eng.allocate_qubit()  # allocate 1 qubit

H | qubit  # apply a Hadamard gate
Measure | qubit  # measure the qubit

eng.flush()  # flush all gates (and execute measurements)
print("Measured {}".format(int(qubit)))  # output measurement result
```

## Strawberry Fields - Xanadu
* An open-source software architecture for photonic quantum computing
* A full-stack quantum software platform, implemented in Python specifically
  targeted to the CV model
* Quantum circuits are written using the easy-to-use and intuitive Blackbird
  quantum programming language
* Includes a suite of CV quantum computer simulators implemented using NumPy
  and TensorFlow - these built-in quantum compiler tools convert and optimize
  Blackbird code for classical simulation
* Future releases will aim to target experimental backends, including photonic
  quantum computing chips

## QISKIT - IBM
* An open-source quantum computing framework for leveraging today's quantum
  processors and conducting research
* We know it somewhat
* Very good documentation.

## Cirq - Google
* Cirq is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
  circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

## Q# - Microsoft
* Uses C#.
* Easier to debug.
* Easier to build desktop applications.
* Interoperability with Python.
* Typed language :'(
* Documentation is not very helpful.
* Minor thing: VS code does not recognize Q# code entirely, and this might be bothering at first.
