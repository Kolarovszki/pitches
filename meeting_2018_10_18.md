# Languages

1. ProjectQ - Indepenent(?)
* compilation framework capable of targeting various types of hardware
* run quantum programs on the IBM Quantum Experience chip
* simulate quantum programs on classical computers
* emulate quantum programs at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., mimicking
  the action of large oracles instead of compiling them to low-level gates)
* export quantum programs as circuits (using TikZ)
* get resource estimates

2. Strawberry Fields - Xanadu
* An open-source software architecture for photonic quantum computing
* A full-stack quantum software platform, implemented in Python specifically
  targeted to the CV model
* Quantum circuits are written using the easy-to-use and intuitive Blackbird
  quantum programming language
* Includes a suite of CV quantum computer simulators implemented using NumPy
  and TensorFlow - these built-in quantum compiler tools convert and optimize
  Blackbird code for classical simulation
* Future releases will aim to target experimental backends, including photonic
  quantum computing chips

3. QISKIT - IBM
* An open-source quantum computing framework for leveraging today's quantum
  processors and conducting research
* We know it somewhat

4. Cirq - Google
* Cirq is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
  circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.
